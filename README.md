# __Career-Application-Form-PHP__
## __INTRODUCTION__
    This project targets career application forms, with database and and report generation.
    This project coinsides with Admin Pages, built to mannage the data and generate report.

    Right now mostly the focus is on design and security.
> Have used vanila PHP as much as possible so that it is easy to implement and deploy for anyone new to PHP.

    Also from experience of filling forms, have encountered the many issues like data getting lost if connection is lost and while uploading images the size is specified which is very hard to manage for normal people, and even if you manege to upload proper image the image comes streshed or squezed.

    This project will also focus on report generation on the side of Admin, also having some basic controls to manage users, their issues and getting final report of applied candidate.


        1. Getting an excel sheet having all related information of candidate.
        2. Producing CV style pdf that Admin can then check and print for record keeping.
        3. Status of people completed and uncompleted forms.
        4. Sendig email to people who have not completed the form but have started filling.
